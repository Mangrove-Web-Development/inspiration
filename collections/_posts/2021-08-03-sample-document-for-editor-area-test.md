## Sample document for editor area test

This document is used in the articles Evaluating WYSIWYG-editors [2006](http://www.standards-schmandards.com/2006/wysiwyg-editor-test/) and [2007](http://www.standards-schmandards.com/2007/wysiwyg-editor-test-2/). It contains various markup features commonly used by content editors or "rédacteurs de contenu" as they are called in [France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France). It is important that a WYSIWYG tool has features that are easily available for the editor. If not, there is a risk that content won't receive **proper** markup. Examples of commonly found content are:

1. Headings
2. Links (with optional title)
3. Lists (like this one)
   * including nested lists
4. Tables
   * caption
   * headers
   * summary
5. Language information
6. Acronyms and abbreviations
7. Emphasis and strong emphasis
8. Quotes, inline and block
9. Images

### Test procedure

In the test we will try to recreate this document using the editor tools. To make sure tables can be inserted *properly* we re-visit banana import statistics from 1998.

For block quotes we will have a look at [what Joe Clark says about redheads](http://fawny.org/rhcp.html)\:

> "Since boyhood I’ve always believed, at the deepest level, that redheads are standard-bearers of the grandest and most wondrous human beauty."

#### This is where we will test the video embed
