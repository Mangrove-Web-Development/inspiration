This week on Everybody in the Pool, we all know it’s a big deal to get lots of drivers to switch from ICE (internal combustion engine) cars to electric cars. But getting them to switch one at a time is for the birds—let’s talk about fleets of cars all at once! Taxi cabs, company cars, delivery vehicles, government cars … what does it take to get hundreds or thousands of cars to go electric? Well, a lot, as it turns out.

Today’s guest is Josh Green, CEO of Inspiration Mobility, which buys and leases electric cars but also provides all the fleet management services a company needs to transition to EVs—which, not for nothing, are cheaper and more reliable to operate once they do. Plus, the surprising reason existing fleet management companies don’t prioritize EVs.
