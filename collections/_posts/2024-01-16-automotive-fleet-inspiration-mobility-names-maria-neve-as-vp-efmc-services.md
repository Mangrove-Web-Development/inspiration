Inspiration Mobility (Inspiration) recently announced that former Wheels and Merchants leader Maria Neve has joined Inspiration Fleet as vice president of eFMC Services.

In this role, Neve will oversee the growth and delivery of Inspiration Fleet’s services platform.

As an eFMC, Inspiration Fleet offers both traditional FMC services, such as [maintenance](https://www.automotive-fleet.com/10205556/prioritizing-fleet-maintenance-issues) and roadside services, and new services and solutions designed to maximize the benefits of [EVs](https://www.automotive-fleet.com/10211555/recent-insights-into-electric-vehicle-sales-and-owners), such as home charging installation and reimbursement, turnkey installation and operations of depot charging, payment for public EV charging, and more.

"Maria is well known in the industry and trusted by fleet professionals at leading organizations across the U.S. They turn to her as one of the top electrification experts in the industry because she understands both the challenges – and opportunities – that fleet electrification brings,” said Inspiration founder/CEO Josh Green. “With Maria on board, Inspiration continues to expand its leadership position as the go-to partner for organizations serious about making real progress towards electrification. From EV procurement to financing to fleet management to charging, we provide companies with a turnkey solution that includes everything they need, and nothing they don’t.”
