*Reflects surging demand for seamless, full-service fleet electrification solutions* &nbsp;

**WASHINGTON, D.C., (January 23, 2023)** – Inspiration Mobility (“Inspiration”), the first end-to-end electric vehicle (EV) solutions company, today announced the addition of three widely recognized senior executives joining the company to spearhead finance, sales, and human capital. With decades of expertise in areas key to financing the transition of commercial fleets to EVs, in concert with exceptional customer service, SungHwan Cho is joining the company as Chief Financial Officer, Edward P. Kaye as Senior Vice President of Sales & Business Development, and Heather Schwager as Senior Vice President & Head of People.

Josh Green, Founder and CEO of Inspiration stated, “Sung, Ed, and Heather bring tremendous value as we continue to scale the leading EV fleet electrification platform in the US. Their addition to the team reflects our phenomenal growth and market traction as commercial customers seek a one-stop partner to transition their fleets to EVs as quickly and painlessly as possible for dramatic cost savings and sustainability benefits.”

[SungHwan Cho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunghwancho/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} (“Sung”) joins as Chief Financial Officer, bringing over 25 years of operational finance leadership and management in private equity and operating companies, including 9 years as Chief Financial Officer at Icahn Enterprises, a diversified holding company conglomerate engaged in automotive, energy, investment, real estate, and several other industries. He has also served on numerous corporate boards, such as Hertz, CVR Energy, Tenneco, American Railcar Industries, and others.
