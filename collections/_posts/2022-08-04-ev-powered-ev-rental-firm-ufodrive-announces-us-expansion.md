*EV Powered, August 4, 2022* —

**UFODRIVE has announced plans to expand operations to the United States following its growth across Europe.**

The first North American UFODRIVE location has launched in San Francisco to be followed quickly by further new locations across Europe and the United States. UFODRIVE is also announcing the opening of a global Tech Hub and Innovation Centre in Dublin later this month, which will serve as focal point for further development of their unique electric rental platform.

To accelerate its North American expansion, UFODRIVE is partnering with Inspiration Fleet, the first EV-only fleet management company. “Our strategic acquisition and financing partnership will allow UFODRIVE to scale nationwide at pace,” said Josh Green, Founder and CEO of Inspiration Mobility. “Together, we will supercharge the transition to sustainable mobility in the rental market and beyond.”
