#### RealLIST Startups: Check out the top 20 DC companies to keep your eye on in 2023

As an example, I had dinner last night with 10 different people, and I'd say three of us have been in this industry, everyone else at the table was like, 'Yeah, I was working in crypto, and it just occurred to me that this is an urgent problem and so I should really devote my career to that.' So it's been really inspiring to see that mix of realization and passion at this event."
