      The global transition to electric mobility is inevitable, but for
      companies looking to take advantage of this tectonic shift, the process of
      deploying EV fleets and the required charging infrastructure is complex
      and time-consuming, with significant upfront costs. With rapidly-evolving
      vehicle models, charging technologies, and incentives (federal, state,
      local, utility),

      critical advantages. Inspiration provides experienced leadership and deep
      expertise in every element crucial for successful EV fleet deployment; we

      <h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>An electrifying force for your gasoline or
      diesel-powered fleet</strong></h2><p>There are more EV models than ever
      before, battery technology has never been better and cheaper, and new
      financial incentives are appearing at an unprecedented pace. No matter
      what type or size of light or medium-duty fleet you manage, now is the
      perfect time to convert to electric vehicles. It&rsquo;s a smart
      investment with tangible returns:</p><ul><li>Fuel savings of
      40-60%</li><li>&nbsp;Up to 60% lower maintenance costs</li><li>Increased
      vehicle uptime and availability</li><li>Driver (and passenger)
      enjoyment</li><li>Reduced greenhouse gas emissions, maintaining brand
      relevance as regulators, investors and consumers demand ESG
      progress</li></ul><p>With these benefits available now and multiplied
      across your entire fleet, every day with an ICE fleet is a missed
      opportunity for lower operating costs, increased profitability, and a
      stronger company brand.</p><h3>Scaling an all-EV fleet or offering a new
      EV mobility innovation? Build your business with
      Inspiration</h3><p>Electric vehicles have spawned a growing ecosystem of
      exciting companies that are, like us, devoted to accelerating the EV

      By almost every measure, electricity is a superior fuel source to gasoline
      and diesel for light- and medium-duty vehicles. But planning and building
      the charging infrastructure to support your business can be complex and
      time-consuming, involving decisions about siting, energy supply, charging
      hardware and software, and real estate in a rapidly evolving energy
      market. Oh, and all of this has to integrate with your choice of EVs, your
      duty cycles and routes, and, perhaps most importantly, your budget.  Let
      us design and finance the optimal solution for your unique needs, ensuring
      all the pieces fit together for maximum benefit.
