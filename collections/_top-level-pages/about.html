    heading: Purpose-built to unlock the full value of electric vehicle fleets
    column_1_text: >-
      The electrification of transportation and mobility is underway and is
      already changing fleet operations. For almost all transportation segments,
      electrification is inevitable: a matter of how fast, not if. 
    column_2_text: >-
      Compared with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, EVs are more
      dependable and have vastly lower operating costs. Fleet electrification
      delivers significantly higher value to operators. So, what’s the hold-up?

    general_content_html: >-
      <p>The reality is that, despite the compelling advantages of
      electrification, successfully deploying EVs at scale is complex, requiring
      the integration of traditionally siloed disciplines. Operators must
      consider factors such as use case and duty cycles; vehicle selection and
      procurement; siting and real estate; charging system design, installation
      and operation; energy procurement and optimization; government
      regulations; incentive management; and vehicle maintenance and
      storage...not to mention how to pay for it all.</p><p>We launched
      Inspiration with one purpose: to accelerate the EV transition by making
      the deployment of electric fleets, at scale, as easy as managing a fleet
      of ICE vehicles. Our team has the cross-functional expertise to enable
      fleet operators to go electric with the lowest risk, highest return on
      investment, and the least friction possible. By engaging deeply with our
      customers and employing innovative financing and partnership structures
      tailored to each customer&rsquo;s unique needs, we enable scale by
      maximizing every advantage EVs have to offer.</p><p>Inspiration&rsquo;s
      team brings together deep experience and capabilities in fleet management,
      infrastructure finance, clean energy project development, automotive
      finance, and real estate. We are a team of dedicated, passionate
      individuals driven by one shared goal: delivering solutions that
      dramatically accelerate the electrification of transportation.</p>
