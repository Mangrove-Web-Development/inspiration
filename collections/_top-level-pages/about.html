    heading: Purpose-built to unlock the full value of electric vehicle fleets
    column_1_text: >-
      The electrification of transportation and mobility is underway and is
      already changing fleet operations. For almost all transportation segments,
      electrification is inevitable: a matter of how fast, not if. 
    column_2_text: >-
      Compared with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, EVs are more
      dependable and have vastly lower operating costs. Fleet electrification
      delivers significantly higher value to operators. So, what’s the hold-up?

    general_content_html: >-
      <p>The reality is that, despite the compelling advantages of
      electrification, successfully deploying EVs at scale is complex, requiring
      the integration of traditionally siloed disciplines. Operators must
      consider factors such as use case and duty cycles; vehicle selection and
      procurement; siting and real estate; charging system design, installation
      and operation; energy procurement and optimization; government
      regulations; incentive management; and vehicle maintenance and
      storage...not to mention how to pay for it all.</p><p>We launched
      Inspiration with one purpose: to accelerate the EV transition by making
      the deployment of electric fleets, at scale, as easy as managing a fleet
      of ICE vehicles. Our team has the cross-functional experience and
      expertise to enable fleet operators to go electric with the lowest risk,
      highest return on investment, and the least friction possible. By engaging
      deeply with our customers and employing innovative financing and
      partnership structures tailored to each customer&rsquo;s unique needs, we
      enable scale by maximizing every advantage EVs have to
      offer.</p><p>Inspiration&rsquo;s team brings together deep expertise and
      capabilities in fleet management, infrastructure finance, clean energy
      project development, automotive finance, and real estate. We are a team of
      dedicated, passionate individuals driven by one shared goal: delivering
      the products and solutions to dramatically accelerate the electrification
      of transportation.</p>
