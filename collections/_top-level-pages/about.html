      <h2>Purpose-built to maximize EV and electric fleet value</h2><p>The
      electrification of transportation and mobility is underway and will
      radically impact passenger fleet operators. Electrification is inevitable:
      a matter of when not if. But, frankly, we thought the transition would be
      farther along by now. After all, compared with gas-powered vehicles, EVs
      have vastly greater longevity and lower maintenance costs. Fleet
      electrification has the potential to deliver significantly better value to
      operators. So, what&rsquo;s the hold-up?</p><p>The reality is that despite
      the crystal clear competitive advantages of fleet electrification,
      adopting EVs requires many complicated decisions involving traditionally
      siloed sectors. Operators must resolve vehicle selection and procurement
      issues, charging infrastructure, energy procurement and optimization,
      government regulations, incentive management, maintenance, and
      storage.&nbsp;</p><p>Our founding partners joined forces with one purpose:
      to accelerate the EV transition. We brought together a team with the
      cross-functional experience and expertise to enable fleet operators to
      make the leap with the least risk possible,&nbsp; the most return on
      investment, and the least friction possible. We plan to scale along with
      our customers by maximizing every advantage of the EV disruption to the
      fleet industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Inspired? Let&rsquo;s do this
      together.</p>
