      <h2>Complete EV Charging and Energy Solutions</h2><p>Electricity is an
      ideal fuel source for fleets: it&rsquo;s cheap, widely available, and its
      price is stable and predictable; but developing, owning and operating EV
      charging infrastructure for your fleet can be daunting, requiring
      significant resources, time and expertise. There are dozens of options for
      hardware and software, complex utility rate structures and incentives,
      siting, permitting and real estate considerations, and many installers and
      operators to choose from. Inspiration is your partner and systems
      integrator for charging infrastructure: we work closely with you to
      design, finance and implement the right solution to meet your needs and
      deliver maximum value. We are vendor- and technology-agnostic, enabling us
      to always select the best-in-class providers and products for your
      specific use case. And beyond just reliably fueling your fleet, we can
      combine our charging infrastructure with other technologies and energy
      programs to minimize the cost of charging and maximize the share of
      electricity from renewable sources. With Inspiration&rsquo;s team of
