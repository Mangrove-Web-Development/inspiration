      <h2><strong>Get your EV mix right, right from the
      start</strong></h2><p>With a rapidly expanding list of vehicle makes and
      models to choose from, designing the optimal EV fleet that&rsquo;s right
      for your business is a critical element of success. Features and benefits
      vary across models, new vehicles are coming to market all the time, and
      supply chains and inventory can be unpredictable. With Inspiration on your
      side, you&rsquo;ll reduce risk by having the best intelligence and the
      right financing options supporting your
      success.</p><ul><li><strong>Use:</strong> Get the best vehicles to move
      your passengers, cargo, or both.</li><li><strong>Range:</strong> Ensure
      that you have all the energy you need to complete trips without
      interruption.</li><li><strong>Cost:</strong> Take full advantage of all
      incentives and minimize vehicle operating
      costs.</li><li><strong>Access:</strong> Leverage our OEM relationships and
      proprietary channels to get vehicles more quickly and
      reliably</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Maximize value with incentives
      and financing</strong></h2><p>The list of incentives and rewards for
      owning EVs and installing charging infrastructure is long and growing.
      Inspiration keeps close tabs on all of them, so you don&rsquo;t have to.
      Combined with our flexible financing structures that share any value
      received from subsidies or incentives, your EV fleet investment will
      generate more value with reduced risk.</p><h3>Federal tax
      credit</h3><p>Most EVs are eligible for a significant tax credit, and we
      actively monitor developments to stay ahead of the game and make sure
      we&rsquo;re taking full advantage. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h3>State tax
      credits</h3><p>Many states offer tax credits or rebates for EV
      purchases.&nbsp; We make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out.</p><h3>Utility
      programs</h3><p>Many electric utilities offer subsidies for EV purchases,
      special rates for EV charging, and other incentives; we design your EV
      fleet plan to capture all available benefits.</p><h3>Environmental
      markets</h3><p>Certain states have adopted policies enabling environmental
      credits for the use of EVs, such as California&rsquo;s Low-Carbon Fuel
      Standard (&ldquo;LCFS&rdquo;), and Federal policy proposals feature
      similar incentives. Eligibility can be complicated, and it is easy to miss
      out on potential value.&nbsp; We are experts in environmental markets and
      ensure no opportunity for additional value is lost.</p><h2><strong>Why
