      <h2><strong>Get your EV mix right, right from the
      start</strong></h2><p>With a rapidly expanding list of vehicle makes and
      models to choose from, designing the optimal EV fleet that&rsquo;s right
      for your business is critical for success.</p><p>Features and benefits
      vary by model, new vehicles come to market all the time, and supply chains
      and inventory can be unpredictable. With Inspiration on your side,
      you&rsquo;ll reduce risk by having the best intelligence and the right
      financing options supporting your
      success.</p><ul><li><strong>Use:</strong> Get the best vehicles, new or
      used, to move your passengers, cargo, or
      both.</li><li><strong>Range:</strong> Ensure that you have all the energy
      you need to complete trips without
      interruption.</li><li><strong>Cost:</strong> Take full advantage of all
      incentives and minimize vehicle operating
      costs.</li><li><strong>Access:</strong> Leverage our OEM relationships and
      proprietary channels to get vehicles more quickly and
      reliably.</li></ul><h2><strong>Maximize value with incentives and
      financing</strong></h2><p>The list of incentives and rewards for owning
      EVs and installing charging infrastructure is long and growing.
      Inspiration keeps close tabs on all of them, so you don&rsquo;t have to.
      Combined with our flexible financing structures that share any value
      received from subsidies or incentives, your EV fleet will generate more
      value with reduced risk.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Federal tax credit:
      </strong>Most EVs are eligible for a significant tax credit, and we
      actively monitor developments to stay ahead of the game and make sure
      we&rsquo;re taking full advantage.</p></li><li><p><strong>State tax
      credits:</strong> Many states offer tax credits or rebates for EV
      purchases - we make sure you don&rsquo;t miss
      out.</p></li><li><p><strong>Utility programs:</strong> Many electric
      utilities offer subsidies for EV purchases, special rates for EV charging,
      and other incentives. We design your EV fleet plan to capture all
      available benefits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Environmental markets:</strong>
      Certain states have adopted policies enabling environmental credits for
      the use of EVs, such as California&rsquo;s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard
      (&ldquo;LCFS&rdquo;), and Federal policy proposals feature similar
      incentives. Eligibility can be complicated, and it's easy to miss out on
      potential value. As experts in environmental markets, we ensure you don't
      lose an opportunity for additional value.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Why
