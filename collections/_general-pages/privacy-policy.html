      <h2><strong>Collecting Information </strong></h2><p>When completing the
      registration form on our website, we may collect information that
      identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an
      individual (&ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;), such as your name,
      address, telephone number, email address, IP address, and contact
      preferences. Personal Information collected online may be supplemented
      with information you provide to us through other services and sources, as
      well as information we obtain from other data collection methods, such as
      lead generation from third party firms. We collect Personal Information as
      follows:</p><p><strong>Direct: </strong>When requesting information on our
      website, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, mailing
      address, phone number or other details to obtain additional information
      from the Company.</p><p><strong>Indirect or Third Party: </strong>The
      Company may receive information about you from third parties. For example,
      if you access our website through a third-party connection or login, or
      through a third-party plug-in, that third party may pass certain
      information about you to the Company. You should always review, and if
      necessary adjust, your privacy settings on third-party websites and
      services that you use to access the Company&rsquo;s
      website.</p><p><strong>Analytics: </strong>To assist the Company in
      improving our website, we may directly, or through a third party
      (including the use of third-party analytics tools), collect analytics
      data, measure traffic and usage trends for our website, including the
      pages you visit, and collect other relevant
      information.</p><p><strong>Cookies: </strong>When you visit our website,
      we may send one or more cookies &mdash; a small text file containing a
      string of alphanumeric characters &mdash; to your computer that uniquely
      identifies your browser and lets the Company help you enhance your
      navigation through our website. A cookie may also convey information to us
      about how you use our website (e.g., the pages you view, the links you
      click and other actions you take on the website), and allow us or our
      business partners to track your usage of our website over time. A
      persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.
      Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to our
      website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web
      browser&rsquo;s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears
      after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all
      cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features
      of our website may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies
      is disabled.</p><p><strong>Log Files: </strong>Log file information is
      automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you
      access our website. When you use our website, our servers automatically
      record certain log file information. These server logs may include
      anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
      (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs,
      number of clicks and how you interact with links on our website, domain
      names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such
      information.</p><p><strong>Clear gifs/Web Beacons: </strong>When you use
      our website, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which
      are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. In
      addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our
      users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by
      recipients. This information allows for more accurate reporting and
      improvement of our website.</p><p><strong>Device Identifiers:
      </strong>When you access our website by or through a mobile device
      (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access,
      collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more &ldquo;device
      identifiers,&rdquo; such as a universally unique identifier
      (&ldquo;UUID&rdquo;). Device identifiers are small data files or similar
      data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which
      uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data
      stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection
      with the device&rsquo;s operating system or other software, or data sent
      to the device by the Company. A device identifier may convey information
      to us about how you browse and use our website. A device identifier may
      remain persistently on your device, to enhance your navigation through our
      website. Some features of our website may not function properly if use or
      availability of device identifiers is impaired or
      disabled.</p><p><strong>Location data: </strong>When you access our
      website, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store
      &ldquo;location data,&rdquo; which may include GPS coordinates (e.g.
      latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location
      of your device. Location data may convey to us information about how you
      browse and use our website. Some features of our website, particularly
      location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability
      of location data is impaired or disabled.</p><p><strong>Commercial and
      marketing communications: </strong>We use the information we collect or
      receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails
      containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want
      to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or
      change your preferences.</p><p>We do not require that customers, partners
      or other visitors to our website provide us with Personal Information and
      you may visit our website anonymously. In this case, we do not collect
      Personal Information when you visit our website unless you choose to
      provide it to us, except for certain IP analysis. The decision to provide
      Personal Information is voluntary and you may withdraw your consent at any
      time by contacting us at <a
      href="mailto:info@inspirationmobility.com">info@inspirationmobility.com</a>.</p><h2><strong>Use
      of Information </strong></h2><p>We use Personal Information for legitimate
      business purposes only. Your Personal Information will not be sold,
      exchanged, transferred or given to any company outside the Company and its
      parent, subsidiary or affiliated entities or our trusted third-party
      service providers for any reason whatsoever without your consent, except
      as noted below:</p><ul><li>The Company may share your information with
      third-party business partners for the purpose of providing services,
      improving our website, personalizing the website experience, or to
      administer a contest, promotion, survey or other website features to you.
      Those business partners will be given limited access to your information
      as is reasonably necessary to deliver services.</li><li>The Company may
      use your Personal Information to perform research, technical diagnostics
      and analytics with regard to our website.</li><li>We may communicate (via
      mail, email or phone call) periodic informational or promotional content.
      However, you can always unsubscribe or choose not to receive promotional
      information from us by following the specific instructions in the email
      you receive or by notifying us using the contact information below. It may
      take a reasonable period of time to process your request, no longer than
      30 days for direct mail and telephone promotions and 10 business days for
      email promotions.</li><li>The Company may buy, sell, divest or transfer
      its stock or assets, or any combination of its products, services, assets
      and/or businesses. Your Personal Information may be among the items sold
      or otherwise transferred in these types of transactions. We may also sell,
      assign or otherwise transfer such Personal Information in the course of
      corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions,
      reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings
      involving all or a portion of the company.</li><li>We may disclose
      Personal Information, or any information you submit to us, if we have a
      good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or
      reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with any applicable law, regulation,
      legal process or governmental request; (ii) to enforce our policies,
      including investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) to
      investigate, detect, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities
      or other wrongdoing, suspected fraud or security issues; (iv) to establish
      or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; (v) to prevent harm
      to the rights, property or safety of us, our users, yourself or any third
      party; (vi) for the purpose of collaborating with law enforcement
      agencies; or (vii) in case we find it necessary in order to enforce our
      intellectual property or other legal rights.</li><li>The Company may share
      certain service type information, including information obtained through
      tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and
      clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs,
      platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with our third-party business
      partners. We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally
      identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data
      with third parties.</li></ul><p>We use the Personal Information only to
      the extent required and while maintaining your right to privacy.</p><p>We
      strive to keep your Personal Information accurate. We have implemented
      technology, management processes and policies to maintain data integrity.
      We will provide you with access to your information when reasonable, or in
      accordance with relevant laws, including making reasonable efforts to
      provide you with the opportunity to change your information. To protect
      your privacy and security, we will take steps to verify your identity
      before granting access or making changes to your data. Requests to delete
      Personal Information are subject to any applicable legal and ethical
      reporting or document retention obligations. To access or correct
      information, you can notify us via the contact information
      below.</p><h2><strong>Retention Period </strong></h2><p>At any time, you
      may request to view, change or update your Personal Information by
      emailing us at <a

      You can also request that we cease processing, correct errors or erase
      your Personal Information by emailing us at <a
      href="mailto:info@inspirationmobility.com">info@inspirationmobility.com</a>.</p><p>Due
      to the possibility of long sales cycles, one never knows when a potential
      client will re-engage with the Company and having the background and
      history of the contracting party will assist the Company in providing a
      better customer experience. Therefore, please note that unless you
      instruct us otherwise, we retain the information we collect for as long as
      needed to provide our software and services and to comply with our legal
      obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p><p>We may
      rectify, replenish or remove incomplete or inaccurate information at any
      time and at our own discretion.</p><h2><strong>Safeguarding and

      our reasonable efforts, in accordance with market best practices, to
      ensure the security, confidentially and integrity of the Personal
      Information you choose to provide us. To protect the privacy of any
      Personal Information you may have provided, we are using data hosts who
      implement market best practice security measures. Although we take steps
      to safeguard such information, we cannot be responsible for the acts of
      those who gain unauthorized access, and we make no warranty, express,
